=== Routes

Routes are defined by:

- a HTTP method ;
- a path expression ;
- a fully qualified method name ;
- optionaly a method parameters definition ;
- and finaly optional modifiers.

The default Werval router allows for textual representation of routes definition.

    http-method path-expression controller-fqcn.method-name[(parameters)] [modifiers]

You can also express routes definitions in code using the Routes API.

Request URI Path and QueryString are the source of Controller Parameters.

You can also handle all the routing in your Global object.

NOTE: URI Fragment identifier is considered useful on the client side only, hence not taken into account when routing.
However, the reverse routing API allow you to append a fragment identifier to generated URIs.
