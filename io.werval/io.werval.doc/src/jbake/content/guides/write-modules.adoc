== Write Modules

=== Quickstart

Module build is easy when using Gradle as a dedicated plugin is available.

`apply plugin: 'io.werval.module'`

You can also start from the `werval-skel-module` skeleton that comes with a complete sample Plugin including unit tests.


=== Plugins

Declare Plugins in your build:

`moduleDescriptor.plugin 'name', impl: 'fqcn.of.YourPlugin'`

You can declare several of them.


=== Documentation

Documentation must be put in `src/doc` in Asciidoc format.
At least the `index.adoc` file must be present.
You can add other files and resources (images...).

When your module is present in an application classpath, its documentation will be automatically listed at
`/@doc/modules/index.html` and integrated at `/@doc/modules/your-module-id` in development mode.
