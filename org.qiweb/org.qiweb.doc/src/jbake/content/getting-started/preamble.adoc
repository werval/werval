[IMPORTANT]
.Install QiWeb SSL certificate
====

QiWeb private hosting use SSL to secure all communications using a self-signed certificate.
You need to add this SSL certificate to the certificates trusted by your Java 8 installation.

NOTE: This step is necessary while the project is private.
Once published we'll be able to remove this step.

This will fetch the certifcate and put it in a file named `qiweb-certificate.pem`:

[source,bash]
----
openssl s_client -connect scm.codeartisans.org:443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -outform pem > qiweb-certificate.pem
----

This will import the certificate in the Java `cacerts` truststore:

[source,bash]
----
sudo keytool -keystore "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts" -storepass changeit -import -trustcacerts -v -alias qiweb-certificate -file qiweb-certificate.pem
----

Once your environment is correctly set up on your computer, you can go on.
