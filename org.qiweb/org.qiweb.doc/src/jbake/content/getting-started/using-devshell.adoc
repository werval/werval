== Using the DevShell

// === Instant feedback

From now on we'll take a closer look at QiWeb Development Shell features.
Begin by starting the application in development mode, see above.

// Add compilation error
At first we will introduce a compilation error in the application sources.
Open `./src/main/java/controllers/Application.java` and make changes that won't compile, eg:

[source,java]
----
package controllers;

import org.qiweb.controllers.*;

public class Application {

    public Outcome index()
    {
        THIS WON'T COMPILE
        return new org.qiweb.controllers.Welcome().welcome();
    }

}
----

If you now hit your browser refresh button you'll see something like that:

image::images/devshell-compile-error.png[Compilation failed,640]

This tells you where the error is.

Now, let's remove the compilation error but throw an exception:

[source,java]
----
package controllers;

import org.qiweb.controllers.*;

public class Application {

    public Outcome index()
        throws java.io.IOException
    {
        if( true )
        {
            Exception crash = new RuntimeException( "Wow, it crashed!" );
            throw new java.io.IOException( "And this would be an explicit error message.", crash );
        }
        return new org.qiweb.controllers.Welcome().welcome();
    }

}
----

If you hit your browser refresh button again, this should show up:

image::images/devshell-exception-error.png[Exception,640]

You'll notice that when application sources are concerned, the error page has links to open them quickly.
Of course this will work better is you setup your development environment to open the files with the right applications.

// Add new feature

Ok, things are failing well :-)
We will now finally say "Hello World" from our HTTP Application.

Change the controller content to:

[source,java]
----
package controllers;

import org.qiweb.api.context.*;

public class Application {

    public Outcome index()
    {
        return CurrentContext.outcomes().ok( "Hello World!" ).build();
    }

}
----

Hit your browser refresh button again.
This time you should see **Hello World!**.

This is how the QiWeb Development Shell gives you instant feedback when coding.
