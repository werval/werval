== Maven Plugin

=== Overview

=== Development mode build logic

The `qiweb:devshell` goal depends on the `compile` phase by default.

Rebuilds trigger the `compile` phase by default too.

In other words, the project is compiled before running the development mode and at each rebuild triggered by a source
code change.


=== Packaging

TIP: If you need RPM or DEB packaging, use the http://mojo.codehaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin[rpm-maven-plugin]
and https://github.com/tcurdt/jdeb[jdeb-maven-plugin]
