== QiWeb Documentation

The whole QiWeb documentation is built using Gradle alongside the codebase.

=== Toolchain explained

The complete documentation toolchain involve more than Gradle itself, it is use as an orchestrator of Asciidoctor for
Asciidoc support, Freemarker for templating and finally, JBake to bake the static websites

Documentation of a given QiWeb version includes core documentation plus dynamic documentation for officially supported
modules.

The documentation build is organized to allow documentation:

- to be hosted in development mode, including the documentation of modules found in your application classpath ;
- to be packaged as downloadable archives including documentation for all officialy supported modules ;
- and to be included in the QiWeb website, versionned, for all QiWeb releases.


==== Core & Dynamic documentation

Both core and dynamic documentation are written using Asciidoc and can contain other static assets such as images and
the like.

===== Core documentation

Core documentation includes a getting started guide, the other guides, the manual, the release-notes and the API
javadoc.
Its sources are in the `org.qiweb.doc` project.

The `org.qiweb.doc` build generates the core documentation using JBake.
The resulting files are included in the JAR at `org/qiweb/doc/html`.

NOTE: `org.qiweb.doc` contains the JBake project that is used later to build the QiWeb Documentation

All documentation source is assembled in a ZIP artifact published with the `doc` classifier:

    org.qiweb:org.qiweb.doc:{qiweb-version}:doc@zip

It contains the complete JBake project.

===== Dynamic documentation

Each QiWeb module can have its own documentation included thanks to dynamic documentation.
This is not called *modules documentation* on purpose, *dynamic documentation* way better convey what is going on under
the hood.
Moreover, this mechanism is applied to officially supported modules only.

TIP: Community modules are documented as explained in the
link:write-modules.html#documentation[module writing guide].

Dynamic documentations are registered by adding the following lines to a `reference.conf` files in the module's
classpath root:

    qiweb.devshell.dyndoc.your-module-id {
        name = "Your shiny module's name"
        base_path = org/qiweb/modules/your-module-id/doc
    }

Static documentation is then be generated at `base_path` in the module's classpath.

All documentation source is assembled in a ZIP artifact published with the `doc` classifier.

Example for the SMTP Module:

    org.qiweb:org.qiweb.modules.smtp:{qiweb-version}:doc@zip

The build system of `org.qiweb.modules` do all that automatically as soon as it can find the `src/doc` directory in a
module's project.


==== Documentation targets

[discrete]
===== Development shell

The `org.qiweb:doc` project host the `DocumentationPlugin` that gets automatically registered in development
mode and setup routes to serve documentation at `/@doc`.

The `DocumentationPlugin` serve core and dynamic documentations directly from the classpath.
It generates a dynamic page with links to all registered dynamic documentations found in the application classpath.
Dynamic documentation and its index are passed through SiteMesh to decorate them with the documentation website layout.

There's no easy way to get live reload of changes made in `org.qiweb.doc`.

The `jbake` Gradle task generates the development mode documentation static part in the `build/jbake` directory.
You can open the static website from there and run `gradle jbake` to see changes applied.

Or, to see the result in-situ, with dynamic documentation served, you can:

- use any application that depends on the QiWeb development version ;
- `gradle install` the `org.qiweb.doc` project ;
- `gradle devshell` your application ;
- refresh `/@doc`.

===== Documentations archives

The `org.qiweb.dist` project that create distributions, does the job of assembling documentation archives.

It depends on `org.qiweb:org.qiweb.doc::doc@zip` and all the `doc` classified ZIP artifacts from officially supported
modules to generate the documentation website.
Dynamic documentation index is generated as an Asciidoc file.

Aggregated documentation JBake project is then processed.
The result is assembled in a ZIP archive published with the `doc` classifier for easy download and offline browsing.

    org.qiweb:org.qiweb.dist:{qiweb-version}:doc@zip

[discrete]
===== Website

The QiWeb website provide general information about QiWeb and its community and embedd documentation sites for all past,
current and develop versions documentations mini-sites.

Notable things included in the website are out of the QiWeb releases lifecycle, like Skeletons and Samples.
Thus, this is built in a separate project, in a separate git repository named `qiweb-website`.

The QiWeb website is generated using JBake again.

The project depends on documentation archives of the past releases, current stable release and development version.
All documentation websites are extracted and used as JBake assets under `/doc`.

The project use the Gradle QiWeb plugin allowing you to get live reload on changes made in the JBake project
(`gradle devshell`).

A `deployWebsite` task allow to deploy the website with a single command line, it is for internal use only though.


=== Contributing to Documentation

As the documentation is stored alongside the code, the contribution workflow is the same as for code contributions.

==== Content

The documents can use code snippets which will extract code from the project.
This is preferred way to include source code in the documentation, since any refactoring will be reflected in the
documentation.

Try to put one sentence on each line.
Lines without empty lines between them still belongs to the same paragraph.
This makes it easy to move content around and produce easier to review patches.

As `{}` are used for Asciidoc attributes, everything inside will be treated as an attribute.
What you have to do is to escape the opening brace: `\{`.
If you donâ€™t, the braces and the text inside them will be removed without any warning being issued!

Here are the QiWeb specific attributes that are set while rendering the documentation:

[role="table table-hover"]
|=======================================================================================================================
|`qiweb-version`            |The version of QiWeb that is being built
|=======================================================================================================================


==== Styling

`org.qiweb.doc` styles the QiWeb Documentation for DevShell and distributions archives.

`org.qiweb.website` embed the QiWeb Documentation as is and styles the website home and some other root pages.
