== Configuration

NOTE: QiWeb configuration use the link:hocon.html[HOCON format] ("Human Optimized Config Object Notation").
It is parsed using https://github.com/typesafehub/config[Typesafe Config].

By default, configuration is loaded from an `application.conf` file present at the root of your classpath.
QiWeb runtime configuration properties default values are automatically loaded from `reference.conf` files from each of QiWeb modules.
You can of course override all theses configuration properties in your `application.conf` file.

If you need to add configuration properties for your application you are encouraged to do so in your `application.conf`
file.

All configuration properties are available to your controllers and filters via the Context object.

[source,java]
----
import static io.werval.api.context.CurrentContext.*;
public MyController {
  public Outcome aControllerMethod() {
    String configValue = application().config().string("your.custom.config.key");
    // Do what you have to do according to the configuration value
    return outcomes().ok("whatever").build();
  }
}
----

All configuration properties can be overriden by defining System Properties.
This means that you can easily provide all configuration on the command line.

IMPORTANT: Every system property is also present in the configuration.
For example, the `java.home` System Property is automatically present in the configuration at the `java.home` key.
In other words, and if you need it, keep in mind that you can use configuration properties from the command line without
defining a default value in any configuration file.

Moreover, some special System Properties allow to use an alternate config file:

- `config.resource` to load configuration from the classpath
- `config.file` to load configuration from the filesystem
- `config.url` to load configuration from an URL

Note that this will replace the `application.conf` file, not add to it.
You still can leverage the inclusion mechanism of HOCON to include your `application.conf` file from the one you
specified using one of the System Properties described above.
