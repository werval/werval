== Getting Started

As a starting point we'll see how to build a "Hello World" style example.
As QiWeb is build system agnostic we'll do this in three flavours: using `qiweb-cli`, Gradle and then Maven.

NOTE: Even if you plan to use Gradle, Maven or any other build system, continue reading as you'll get
accustomed to the way QiWeb applications are layed out and will learn how to generate skeleton applications
quickly.

// For the code-impatients, our https://github.com/qiweb/org.qiweb.getting-started[getting-started repository] contains
// the code presented in theses sections.

After that we'll take a look at the QiWeb development shell features.
We hope you'll find your way through.
