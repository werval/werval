== Librairies

Libraries contains non-core functionnality.
Libraries are simple JARs and can contain controllers, utility classes and QiWeb Plugins.

NOTE: Libraries presented here are maintained by the QiWeb team, documented, tested and evolve along the core SDK.
At the end of this document, you'll find external libraries maintained by the community.

//  ==== Array and Hash QueryString Parameters
//
//  Here comes the magic.
//
//  WARNING: All magic comes at a price, this one comes with unsafety. Make sure you really need this and understand what is
//  implied.
//
//  Some frameworks allows using special syntax to pass hashes and arrays into a query string.
//  The most well known of this kind must be
//  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#hash-and-array-parameters[Ruby on Rails].
//
//  QiWeb implement support for similar behaviour. It is controlled by the `qiweb.http.query-string.array-parameters.*`
//  configuration properties.
//
//  Here are the default values:
//
//      qiweb.http.query-string.array-n-hash.enabled = no
//      qiweb.http.query-string.array-n-hash.multi-valued-policy = single
//
//  Valid values for `multi-valued-policy` are `last`, `first`, and `single`.
//
//  In short: `foo[]=bar&foo=bazar&foo[0]=cathedral`.
//
//  With the former example you'll get `foo = [ "cathedral", "bar", "bazar" ]`.
//
//      foo=bar&foo[]=bazar&foo[2]=awesome&foo[2]=tricky&foo[0]=cathedral
//      # LAST
//      foo = [ "cathedral", "bar", "tricky", "bazar ]
//      # FIRST
//      foo = [ "cathedral", "bar", "awesome", "bazar ]
//      # SINGLE
//      BAD REQUEST
