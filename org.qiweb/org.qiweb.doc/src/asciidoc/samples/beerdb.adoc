=== Beer Database

This second sample application is a bit more complex, yet the code is quite small regarding what is does.

It is a beer database, with breweries and beers.
The application expose a HTTP API using HAL-JSON to provide HATEOS enabled ReSTful interactions.

Persistence is done using JPA 2 using EclipseLink implementation.
In DEV and TEST mode, an in-memory H2 database is used.
In PROD mode, PostgreSQL is the database server.
HAL JSON representations are built using HALBuilder.

Browser based front-end is built using Twitter Bootstrap and AngularJS.

The Gradle build handle Bootstrap LESS compilation and Javascript optimization.
Thanks to this, the front-end loads in three requests, the html host page, the CSS bundle and then the Javascript
bundle.
