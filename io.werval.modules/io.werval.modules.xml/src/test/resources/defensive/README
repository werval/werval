Sample files to defensively assert parsers behaviours

Files in this directory are from the fedora-defensive-coding book.

See https://github.com/fweimer/fedora-secure-coding and the LICENSE file next to this one.

All thoses files are not distributed within Werval artifacts, they are only used for automated testing purpose.


Local changes
-------------

Files in the 'cataloged' subdirectory were added to run the test suite with a XML-Catalog.

XML-Parser-External_Entity_Public.xml and XML-Parser-External_Entity_System.xml had to be changed because it they the
same systemId for a referenced entity than other files use for a referenced DTD.

Change

    <!ENTITY e1 SYSTEM "./XML-Parser-Referenced.xml">

To

    <!ENTITY e1 SYSTEM "./XML-Parser-Referenced_ENTITY.xml">
