== Getting Started

As a starting point we'll see how to build a "Hello World" style example.
As QiWeb is Build System Agnostic the framework don't provide one thus the simplest example involve build related
content so is not close to a "one-liner".
However we've packed examples for various Build Systems, even a fully hand-made one based on a simple command line
interface.
We hope you'll find your way through.

For the code-impatients, our https://github.com/qiweb/org.qiweb.samples[samples repository] contains the code presented
in theses sections plus a bunch of usefull samples.
